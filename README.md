# **scRNAseq Interspecies Analysis** 

This branch is compilation of the code (most R) used for different scRNAseq analysis and their posterior inter-species analysis, most of it originally learned at HarvardX, Seurat vignettes and _Tosches et al., 2018_.

The code for initial and final single cell analysis (after subsetting) of each species is me9 (mouse E9,5) and ce3 (chicken E3,2), with the number of each subsetting round (1,2,3). The correlation code is based on the Gene Specificity Indexes of _Tosches et al., 2018_ and the label transfer carried out following Satija lab vignettes and guidelines (matches files summarise graphically the percentages of cells transfered to an identity or other). Finally, the integration code for 3 vertebrate species (zebrafish, chicken and mice).
